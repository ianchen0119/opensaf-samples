This directory contains various examples of imm usage.
Currently we have:

	* immsv_test_classes.xml:  A file for test classes.
	  The testclass(es) can be added to your system by an 
	  "immcfg -f immsv_test_classes.xml".

	* imm_utils: A collection of utility functions intended to make life
          easier for programmers forced to use the SAF-IMM C API.
          This is provided as is, take it or leave it, for use by anyone
          that finds it convenient for accessing the OpenSAF IMM.
          To use it you need to copy and integrate it into your own build.
          There is no Makefile here.

	* immom_python: A python interface to the ImmOm interface.
          Se README in subdirectory.
