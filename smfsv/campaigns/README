  This directory contains campaigns that can be used as examples or
  for testing.

  The campaigns should contain a comment near the top-of-file that
  describes prerequisites, howto execute the campaign and the expected
  outcome.

  For now the campaigns must be executed manually on a 5-node UML
  cluster but it is possible to automatize the tests.
