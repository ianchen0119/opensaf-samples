  This directory contains campaigns that can be used as examples for different redundancy models or
  for testing.

  The campaigns should contain a comment near the top-of-file that
  describes prerequisites, how to execute the campaign and the expected
  outcome.

  For now the campaigns must be executed manually on a 5-node UML
  cluster.

  For more detailed information about running campaigns in UML look at SMF samples directory;
  <opensaf dir>/samples/smfsv/README
